Description: A flexible framework for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) 
    that integrates with the tidyverse. Define simulation models and summary 
    statistics as standard R functions, use 'dist_fns' to represent prior and 
    posterior distributions, and perform inference via rejection sampling, 
    Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or Adaptive ABC. The package provides tools 
    for diagnostics, visualization, and convergence assessment, enabling 
    reproducible Bayesian inference for complex models with intractable 
    likelihoods.
