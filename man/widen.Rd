\title{Increase the dispersion of a distribution}
\usage{
widen(x, scale, knots = NULL, name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a distribution as a \code{dist_fns} S3 object}

\item{scale}{acts as a multiplier for the log-odds difference from the
median, effectively acting like an odds-ratio parameter. A \code{scale > 1} increases
dispersion (stretches quantiles away from the median in logit space), while
\verb{0 < scale < 1} decreases dispersion (compresses quantiles towards the median
in logit space). The median value is preserved in the
original parameter space.}

\item{knots}{the number of knots in the transformed distribution, if it is
not already an empirical CDF distribution.}

\item{name}{a name for the widened distribution}
}
\value{
an empirical \code{dist_fn} with the same median and increased SD. This
transformation will change the mean of skewed distributions.
}
\description{
Increases the dispersion (spread) of a distribution by transforming its
quantile function in a standardized Q-Q space.
}
\details{
The transformation aims to increase the standard deviation by a factor
\code{scale} while preserving the median. It operates on the
internal Q-Q space representation (\code{qx}, \code{qy}) of an empirical distribution
generated by \code{empirical_cdf}.

Applies a logit-space scaling transformation centred on the median quantile.
This transformation modifies the quantile axis (\code{qx}) in the Q-Q space of an
empirical distribution to change its dispersion while preserving the median
value.

Let \code{qx} be the original quantile coordinate in \verb{[0, 1]}, and \code{qmedian} be the
quantile corresponding to the median (e.g., \code{qx_from_qy(0.5)}). The transformation
is defined as:

\deqn{
  qx_2 = \text{expit}\left( (\text{logit}(qx) - \text{logit}(qmedian)) \times \text{scale} + \text{logit}(qmedian) \right)
}

where \eqn{\text{logit}(x) = \log(x / (1 - x))} and \eqn{\text{expit}(x) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-x))}
are the standard logit and inverse-logit functions, respectively.
