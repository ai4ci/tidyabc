# tidyabc: Approximate Bayesian Computing with Tidy Data

A flexible framework for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) that
integrates with the tidyverse. Define simulation models and summary
statistics as standard R functions, use 'dist_fns' to represent prior
and posterior distributions, and perform inference via rejection
sampling, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or Adaptive ABC. The package
provides tools for diagnostics, visualization, and convergence
assessment, enabling reproducible Bayesian inference for complex models
with intractable likelihoods.
