# Sigmoid functions

Sigmoid functions

## Arguments

- n:

  a vector of lengths

- n_50:

  the size at 50 percent

- n_01:

  the size at 1 percent, and the limit of the returned `p` value such
  that \\p \times n \ge n\_{01}\\

- n_100:

  an offset under which the value is 1 (default is 0)

- p_max:

  the maximum value at `n <= n_100`
